In the heart of my professional journey, I've thrived as a Technical Leader for over 3 years, orchestrating cross-functional agile teams with finesse. I've sculpted my expertise working in harmony with Product Owners and stakeholders, seamlessly translating intricate business needs into robust tech solutions. My approach is systematic, rooted in the principles of Domain Driven Design (DDD), where I don't just build systems; I engineer solutions that are emblematic of synergy between technology and business.

For nearly a decade, I've been immersed in the world of Software Development, a realm where my passion meets proficiency. With a palette of languages including Typescript, Javascript, Node.js, and Python, I've woven a tapestry of reliable, scalable, and maintainable software systems. It's not just about writing code; it's about architecting systems that stand the test of time, systems that breathe life into the digital realm.

What truly sets my soul on fire is collaboration. I revel in the dynamism of cross-functional agile teams, where creativity meets strategy. Collaborating closely with Product Owners and stakeholders, I find joy in harmonizing their vision with the intricate nuances of technology. It's about more than just understanding requirements; it's about creating an ecosystem where technology and business symbiotically evolve.

My passion extends to the realm of clean microservices architecture. I'm not just an advocate; I'm a practitioner. I've delved into the depths of monolithic systems, skillfully unraveling their intricacies and transforming them into sleek, efficient microservices. Tech debt isn't a burden; it's a challenge I embrace, strategizing its minimization and fearlessly refactoring legacy code into the elegant simplicity of DDD.

As a fully hands-on Tech-Lead engineer, I don't just lead from the front; I guide from within. I mentor my colleagues, sharing the wisdom of strategic decoupling, the artistry of performant APIs, and the intricacies of devolving monoliths into microservices. My role isn't just about managing tasks; it's about fostering a culture of innovation, where each line of code weaves a story of progress and each challenge becomes a stepping stone toward excellence.

In the tapestry of my career, these experiences aren't mere bullet points; they're chapters that narrate a compelling story of dedication, innovation, and unwavering passion for the art and science of technology. Every project I undertake, every team I lead, and every line of code I write is a testament to my commitment to the ever-evolving intersection of business and technology.
